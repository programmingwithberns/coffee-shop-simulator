# Coffee Shop Simulator

## Project description
Jason opened a coffee shop at the beach and sells coffee
in three sizes: small (9oz), medium (12oz), and
large (15oz). The cost of one small cup is $1.75,
one medium cup is $1.90, and one large cup is $2.00.

Write a menu-driven program that will make the coffee shop operational.
Your program should allow the user to do the following:
- Buy coffee in any size and in any number of cups.
- At any time show the total number of cups of each size sold.
- At any time show the total amount of coffee sold.
- At any time show the total money made.

NB:
The buy coffee option allows the customer to select the number
of cups in each of the sizes they want to order and display a
receipt for that order. The other three options would be used
by the owner to check on the status of the shop during the day.

Pay attention to the user interface. Try to minimize the number
of mouse clicks and display output neatly.
